# ML Content Library
*Curated notes and links on ML + AI projects, papers, and tools.*

Creating a storehouse for all the cool ML (and AI) content I come across. It's a living library where I collect projects, papers and tools -- ranging from foundational research to frontier applications in history, the environment, and multimodal AI:

## Sections
- **Personal Projects**
- **Cool Reads**
- **Agentic AI**
- **Foundational Research Papers**
- **Environmental and Climate Projects**
- **NLP and Multimodal Projects**
- **History Projects**

## How to Use:
Open the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dAQlWF2qLtO5kFMdoVWnYcKy1Lb3H-XP#scrollTo=hc0LFukQ1t4y) for the full, annotated collection.
